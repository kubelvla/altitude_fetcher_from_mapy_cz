# altitude_fetcher_from_mapy_cz
Html page glued together from two examples of API provided by mapy.cz, belonging to a Czech site, seznam.cz.
Allows you to insert gpx file contencts and looks up altitude for each track point in the track[0].
Written  since the mapy.cz site does not export the altitude as a part of the gpx file. This way, you can hopefully process it more easily.
The output can be copied and used.
